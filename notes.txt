Rolling my head to the right gives a negative roll angle.


planB-arduino/arduino-demos/arduino_3/arduino_3.ino has code for the encoders

There is a flaw in the design! If the base motor has moved the shaft all the way up and you turn the shoulder too far, the wire harness get contorted
and snaps off!

The colors for the encoder wiring on the shoulder are red with red, yellow with green, and blue with white, and bare wire with bare wire?
                                                        i.e., red/red, yellow/green, blue/white.

When the arm is extended all the way out, the RASM is VERY unstable.

Bring camera with me.


"cap >> temp" is causing problems for clock_gettime(). See the ~/q* files. 
Please note that millis() will overflow after 50 days of continuous operation of the Arduino program!
