Rolling my head to the right gives a negative roll angle.


planB-arduino/arduino-demos/arduino_3/arduino_3.ino has code for the encoders

There is a flaw in the design! If the base motor has moved the shaft all the way up and you turn the shoulder too far, the wire harness get contorted
and snaps off!

The colors for the encoder wiring on the shoulder are red with red, yellow with green, and blue with white, and bare wire with bare wire?
                                                        i.e., red/red, yellow/green, blue/white.
