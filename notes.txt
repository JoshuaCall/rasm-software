Use "catkin config --extend /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO} --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release" and "catkin build" to build files for motion planning from motion-planning/ws_moveit/ and then source the workspace using "source ws_moveit/devel/setup.bash", changing the file path as necessary.

THREE MAIN GOALS: Park, home, search.
Programmed home and park position, search algorithm to find a face and lock onto the face and track it (if it loses the face go back into the search function and try to find
it or go to home or park).


Please note that the motor encoder for the shoulder
has a problem where it skips about 11 degrees (or approximately
35 steps) when it is changing from positive to negative values;
i.e., at around theta = 0 degrees.

Move the common functionality of manually_move_the_motors and other files to a header file.
Change d3 (in the DH parameters) and upload DH parameter drawings to GitHub.
Change the urdf file joints to be named "shoulder" and "elbow."

Rolling my head to the right gives a negative roll angle.


planB-arduino/arduino-demos/arduino_3/arduino_3.ino has code for the encoders

There is a flaw in the design! If the base motor has moved the shaft all the way up and you turn the shoulder too far, the wire harness get contorted
and snaps off!

The colors for the encoder wiring on the shoulder are red with red, yellow with green, and blue with white, and bare wire with bare wire?
                                                        i.e., red/red, yellow/green, blue/white.

When the arm is extended all the way out, the RASM is VERY unstable.

Bring camera with me.


"cap >> temp" is causing problems for clock_gettime(). See the ~/q* files. 
Please note that millis() will overflow after 50 days of continuous operation of the Arduino program!

||Where to go from here?
||Talk to Prof. Merryweather, Ross, people in the lab.
||Train different angles of the face? Yikes
||What to do about noise?
||Smoother motors? How?
||DH parameters? How to move properly through 6 degrees of freedom?

It would probably be a good idea to replace the current call to Serial.readBytes(buf, width_angle) with a call to some
version of Serial.readStringUntil(), which might require replacing atoi() with toInt().


Just putting this here so I don't accidentally lose the right encoder values if I revert something to a previous commit:
  if (pitch_encoder_reading < 90 && pitch_speed > 0)
  {
    pitch_speed = 0;
  }
  else if (pitch_encoder_reading > 150 && pitch_speed < 0)
  {
    pitch_speed = 0;
  }
  if (yaw_encoder_reading > 100 && yaw_encoder_reading < 700 && yaw_speed > 0)
  {
    yaw_speed = 0;
  }
  else if (yaw_encoder_reading < 900 && yaw_encoder_reading > 200 && yaw_speed < 0)
  {
    yaw_speed = 0;
  }
