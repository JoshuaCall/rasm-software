These instructions will be based on using a GNU/Linux operating system
using the apt package manager (some instructions might end up being dependent
on using Ubuntu 18.04).

1. Download the dlib tar.bz2 file from dlib.net
2. Extract this zipped archive into the folder of your choosing.
3. Install cmake via 'sudo apt-get install cmake'
4. Make the directory on your computer for where you want to store the RASM code.
5. Install git via 'sudo apt-get install git' and then type 'git init' in the folder where you will store the code.
Add the remote origin to the git repository by typing 'git remote add origin https://github.com/JoshuaCall/rasm-software'
6. Install the code in that same directory using 'git pull https://github.com/JoshuaCall/rasm-software'
7. Copy the file build/CMakeLists.txt to a new directory with the name of your choice, for example, a directory called myBuild/
This new directory should be a subdirectory of the main repository directory. Otherwise, the data/face_model_68_points.dat will
not be properly located by the code.
All further references to CMakeLists.txt in these instructions will refer to this new, copied version of CMakeLists.txt
in this new directory unless otherwise specified.
8. Change the line of CMakeLists.txt that says 'add_subdirectory(/home... dlib_build) so that is instead says
            add_subdirectory([absolute_path_to_where_you_extracted_the_dlib_files]/dlib dlib_build) 
9. Change the line of CMakeLists.txt that says 'add_executable(main-code ...' so that it instead says
            add_executable(main-code [absolute_path_to_where_you_created_the_git_repo]/main.cpp)
10. Run 'sudo apt-get install build-essential'
11. Run 'sudo apt-get install libopencv-core3.2' (Note that this step hasn't been tested in full, you may need to install other
components of opencv 3.2, which could be possible via 'sudo apt-get install libopencv*3.2' If you are using an old version of Ubuntu that
doesn't have opencv 3.2 in it's repositories, you will need to follow the installation instructions from opencv's website that involve building from source using 
cmake, since the code doesn't work with older versions of opencv).
12. Run 'sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-numpy python3-serial'
13. Run 'cmake .' inside of the new directory where you copied the CMakeLists.txt file to.
14. Run 'cmake --build .' inside of this same new directory that you have copied the CMakeLists.txt file to.
15. Running 'cmake --build .' is how you will compile the code after you make any changes, and the file ./main-code
is the executable file that will be generated.


Notes for installing arduino:
You will probably need to install arduino by downloading it off of their website, as the
version in the repositories is often out of date. After you have done that, follow
these steps in order to compile the .ino files in the Arduino IDE.
1. Install the motor driver library by clicking on Tools > Manage Libraries and then searching for
DualMC33926MotorShield. Install the library that appears with the name DualMC33926MotorShield that is
provided by Pololu.
2. Change the board by clicking Tools > board and setting the board selection to
"Arduino/Genuino Mega or Mega 2560."
3. You may have to add yourself to the group "dialout." If you try to upload to the Arduino and it
says that you don't have permission, then type 'ls -l /dev/ttyACM0' with the Arduino connected. It will
list the group, probably called dailout, and you can add yourself to this group by typing
'sudo adduser [userName] [groupName]' You will have to restart your computer to be added to the group.
4. Create a symbolic link to arduino_extra/common.h in your Arduino libraries folder. To do this, you
will need to first find your libraries folder. Do this by clicking File > New. Then, in this new sketch,
click File > Save As. This will open a file browser dialog in the location of your main Arduino directory.
Make note of where this directory is. Close the file browser and open a terminal in the location of your
main Arduino directory. Execute the following two commands in order:
cd libraries
ln -s [absolute_path_to_where_you_created_the_git_repo]/arduino_extra/common.h

You should now be able to compile the arduino_main code. You may have to
select the correct board and also select port /dev/ttyACM0 under "Tools"
every time you open Arduino. 

Note that when you the main code is running on your computer, the only way to exit is to 
hit the escape key when the window showing the camera feed is selected.
